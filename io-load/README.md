# File Based Semaphore Lock Failure

## Problem statement

Two applications compete over the io badwidth. Example heavy disk operation.

## Assumptions

## Observations

Heavy IO load, degraded performance of the applications.

## Investigations path

Use iotop or other application to display the system IO load. Determine the process type and PID.
